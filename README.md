# term-shootingGame

## Description

This is a cli shooting game written in python.

## Requirements

Python3 is required. On a Unix-like operating system, that is all.

Windows users should note that this program depends on **curses**,
a python package not available on Windows, although it is part of
the python standard library. To solve this problem, you can run it
on WSL. \(It was on WSL that this game was developed.\) Maybe you
can try [windows-curses](https://pypi.org/project/windows-curses/),
but I am not sure whether it will work.

## Usage

In your favourite shell, execute "play" \(or "python3 play" if you
like\).

Press **"q"** to quit this program anytime when you find your boss
behind you.
